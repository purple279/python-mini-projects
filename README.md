# Python Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of beginner to intermediate Python mini projects.
These projects are designed to practice **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **file handling**, 
and **real-world problem solving**. Each project has its own folder with code and a detailed README.
